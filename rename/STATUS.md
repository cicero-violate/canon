  Current system can now:

  - Build Model₀ from database::graph_log::GraphSnapshot.
  - Apply move-only refactors as graph mutations.
  - Project Plan₁ deterministically into fix_point/ without touching src/.
  - Enforce explicit visibility metadata mapping.
  - Reparse and validate fixpoint output.
  - Avoid git-branch enforcement and avoid destructive rollbacks.

  Nice progress—this is now a stable, non-destructive plan emission pipeline.
