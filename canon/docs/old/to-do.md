Implement a Materializer that projects validated Canonical IR into a source file tree.
The materializer MUST be a pure, deterministic function.
Input is a fully validated CanonicalIr.
Output is an in-memory FileTree representation.
The materializer MUST NOT perform validation.
The materializer MUST NOT infer or invent structure.
One module maps to one directory under src/.
Each module directory contains a mod.rs.
Structs emit Rust struct declarations with fields only.
Traits emit Rust trait declarations with function signatures only.
Impl blocks emit Rust impl blocks binding struct to trait.
Functions emit signatures matching Canonical IR exactly.
Function bodies MUST contain todo!() unless execution exists.
No control flow may be generated by the materializer.
No loops, recursion, or branching may be emitted.
Visibility MUST match Canonical IR visibility exactly.
Call graphs and tick graphs MUST NOT affect emission order.
GPU functions MUST NOT emit kernels, only scalar stubs.
Emitted text is a derived artifact, not a source of truth.
Materializer output MUST round-trip under replay without divergence.
