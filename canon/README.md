# Canon: Law-Governed Structural Intelligence
 
A structural intelligence engine that treats the 100-line Canonical Build
Instructions as binding law.

## Implementation Status

**Current: 91% Structurally Complete**

- ✅ **Core Architecture** (Lines 1-50): 100% — All validation rules enforced
- ✅ **Judgment & Learning** (Lines 51-75): 98% — Structural framework complete
- ⚠️ **Parallelism & GPU** (Lines 76-90): 80% — Structure validated, runtime pending
- ✅ **Meta-Rules** (Lines 91-100): 100% — All properties satisfied

See `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for detailed line-by-line analysis.
See `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for remaining work (runtime execution, proof validation, GPU).
