//! RefactorProposal pipeline: Observe → Reason → Prove → Judge → Mutate.
//!
//! Pure data pipeline — no LLM calls, no async.
//! Each stage validates the previous stage's output before proceeding.
//! If any stage fails the pipeline halts with a typed PipelineError.
//!
//! The caller drives each stage by supplying AgentCallOutputs from their
//! LLM client. The pipeline assembles them into IR mutations via the
//! existing accept_proposal + apply_deltas + Lyapunov gate chain.
//!
//! If nodes were skipped due to insufficient trust the pipeline short-circuits
//! at the first missing stage and returns PipelineError::StageSkipped so the
//! runner can log the incomplete tick without penalising the ledger.
